// Like Java, Scala has "packages". These are also similar to C# namespaces.
// They help us to organise our code. We can call things from other packages, eg in the test we just say
// our test class extends `munit.FunSuite` (the FunSuite class from the munit package).
// or we can say `import munit.FunSuite` if we wanted to be able to refer to it just as `FunSuite` rather than by its
// "fully qualified name" (the name inlcuding the package).

/*
 * In Java, most things needed to be wrapped in a class.
 * 
 * In Scala (as of version 3), quite a lot of things (e.g. functions) can just be declared at the "top level" - i.e.,
 * not inside a class or object. This is a little more Python-like.
 * 
 * So, let's start with some functions that we'll write at the top level.
 * 
 * By the way, as you've just seen:
 * 
 *   // Is a single line comment
 *   /* and */ surround block comments
 *
 * And Scala knows about nesting block comments - the end comment marker above didn't end this outer comment!
 */


/**
  * Just below this comment is a main method. This means you can run this object (eg, "sbt run", or "run" at the sbt prompt).
  * You'll notice I've been able to give it a name other than "main" - the annotation `@main` has marked it as a 
  * main method. 
  * 
  * Because it's a slightly longer method, I've wrapped in in Java-like curly braces { ... }. Scala understands these,
  * so do most IDEs, and they can help visually identify where something finishes.
  * 
  * However, we could delete the curly braces, in which case the compiler would rely on the indentation to know when
  * the function definition finishes. It would also give us compiler errors if our indentation was wrong (which is
  * helpful because it forces us to indent things correctly, rather than confuse readers of our program with 
  * wrong indentation).
  * 
  * 
  *
  * EXERCISE 1: start an sbt shell for this project (remember, start it from the directory containing build.sbt)
  * and "run" this class to see the message printed out. 
  * 
  * (Because there is more than one main method available, sbt will ask you which to run)

  // Also notice Scala's "string interpolation" format.
  // The "s" before the string turns it into a function that will fill in the arguments in the string
  // The arguments start with a $. If it's just a variable name, it can just be $i. 
  // If it's a longer expression, you'll need to put curly braces around it, e.g. ${i + 1}

  // TASK 2a: Try changing i to 3 by uncommenting the next line, and re-run the code. You should find you get a compile error.
  // i = 3

  // This is a variable. Its value can change
  var x:Int = 0

  // TASK 2b: Try changing x to 3 and see what happens
  // i = 3
  // println(s"x is now $x")


  // Below is a function. 
  // * Notice the equals! 
  // * Notice there's no return statement necessary! 
  //   Scala is expression-based -- everything (including if statements) evaluates to a value.
  // * Notice this time, I didn't put any curly braces and just used indentation to mark where the function begins and
  //   ends!
  // * Notice we've just declared a function locally inside a function! 
  //   (This code and comment is still inside the exercise2 function.)
  // 
  // The block of code evaluates to a value (2 * i). 
  // And we've declared that's what twice(i) equals...
  def twice(i:Int):Int = 
    2 * i

  // Here's another function.
  // * Notice this time I just wrote it all on one line. 
  // * Notice I omitted the return type and let the compiler infer it. (Though often we will declare the return type)
  def thrice(i:Int) = 3 * i
  
  // TASK 2c: Use println and twice functions to print out what twice 128 is
  // <<Your code goes here>>

  // Now you've completed Exercise 2, Exercise 3 will involve running the tests
}




/*
 * EXERCISE 3
 * 
 * Ok, hopefully just with that little playing around, you've got the hang of typing in some Scala code, running it, 
 * and seeing what happened (eg, looking for printlns)
 *
 * Now for some exercises that involve running a test suite.
 * 
 * The tests are defined in src/test/scala/cosc250/firststeps/FirstStepsSuite.scala 
 * (which I've written for you).
 * 
 * When you run the tests, you'll see most of them fail with a message saying "an implementation is missing".
 * That's because the tests are calling the functions below, which you're going to implement.
 * When you've implemented the functions, the tests should pass.
 * 
 * You'll need to replace the `???` with actual code. And your goal is to make the tests pass.
 * 
 * You can crib at the tests if you like - they're in the src/test/scala directory. But make the tests pass by
 * writing proper code. (Rather than deciding, "well, it's only testing doubleArray for Array(7) so I'll just always
 * return Array(14)".
 *
 * To run the tests, start an interactive sbt prompt and run the command "test"
 * The test framework will run every test that is defined in src/test/scala
 *
 * Run them now, and scroll up to the first test that failed. Then make it pass, and move on to the next one.
